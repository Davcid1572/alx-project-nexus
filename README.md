## ⚔️ Challenges Faced & Solutions
### 1. Managing Complex State
**Challenge:** Handling asynchronous data and shared state across components.  
**Solution:** Leveraged proper state lifting, hooks, and predictable data flows.

### 2. Type Errors & Bugs
**Challenge:** Initial difficulty with TypeScript strictness.  
**Solution:** Improved type definitions and embraced compile-time error checking.

### 3. Backend Integration
**Challenge:** Inconsistent or evolving backend APIs.  
**Solution:** Close collaboration with backend learners and clear API contracts.
